# Aoki

Aoki is an open-source macOS application designed to capture scrolling screenshots with a customizable selection area and menu interface. It allows users to define a capture region, take stitched scrolling screenshots, and save them to various destinations (e.g., Desktop, Clipboard, Preview). Built with Swift and leveraging AppKit and ScreenCaptureKit, Aoki provides a sleek overlay-based UI for precise control.

```

## How It Works

- **Overlay System**: `OverlayManager` creates overlays on all screens, managed by `OverlayView`, which delegates drawing and interaction to `SelectionRectangleView` and `MenuBarView`.
- **Screenshot Capture**: `ScreenshotUtilities` uses ScreenCaptureKit to capture the defined rectangle, excluding the app’s UI.
- **Scrolling Capture**: `StitchingManager` combines screenshots into a single image using overlap detection.
- **Thumbnail**: `ThumbnailView` provides an interactive preview with drag-and-drop and swipe gestures.
